## Introduction

Human ears can hear sound waves ranging from 20 Hz to 20 kHz.
Sounds above 20 kHz are called ultrasonic sounds.

## Production of Ultrasonic Waves

### Magnetostriction generator

> **Magnetostriction effect:** When a rod of ferromagnetic material (such as iron or nickel) is placed in a magnetic field parallel to its length,
> the rod experiences a change in length.
> This change is independent of the direction of the magnetic field and is only dependent on the magnitude of the field and the nature of the material.
> This phenomenon is known as Magnetostriction effect.
>
> Nickel exhibits a large magnetostriction effect compared to other ferromagnetic materials.

A simple method of producing longitudinal vibrations is to apply an AC magnetic field parallel to the axis of the rod of a ferromagnetic material.
An AC magnetic field is produced by wounding coil of wire around the rod and by passing AC current through it.
Let the frequency of the AC current by $f$.
The rod changes in length for once every half-cycle.
If the rod is not magnetized initially, the change in length may either be elongation or contraction.
Normally, the amplitude of vibrations are small,
but when the frequency of the alternating fields is equal to the natural frequency of the rod,
resonance occurs and the vibrations will be considerably larger.
Further, if the frequency of the alternating fields lie in ultrasonic range,
and ultrasound of frequency $2f$ will be generated in the medium present at the ends of the rod.

As the rod vibrates longitudinally, the following relation governs the frequency of oscillations

$$
f = \frac{m}{2L}\sqrt{\frac{Y}{\rho}}
$$
