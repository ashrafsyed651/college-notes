# Programming in C

## Introduction to C

### Tokens

**Tokens are the smallest unit in a program**

* Identifiers
* Keywords (32)
* Constants (Literals)
* Strings
* Special symbols/characters
* Operators

### Compiler and Linker

Machine (Binary) <=> Operating System (Object Codes) <=> C Program (Humans)
Compiler and linker are between OS and C Program

## Data

* Data - Raw facts
* Information - Processed meaningful data

### Data Types

1. Basic datatypes

* int
* float
* char
* void
* double
* short
* long
* string

2. Derived datatypes

* Arrays
* Functions
* Pointers
* Unions (`union`)
* Structures (`struct`)

3. Enumeration datatypes

* `enum`

### Memory storage

Memory addresses are stored in hexadecimal

* Binary digit is called a **bit**
* 8 Bits = 1 Byte

First digit of a binary number is called **MSB (Most signifiant bit)**

Last digit of a binary number is called **LSB (Least signifiant bit)**
