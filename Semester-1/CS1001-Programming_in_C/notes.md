# Programming in C

## Introduction to C

### Tokens

**Tokens are the smallest unit in a program**

* Identifiers
* Keywords (32)
* Constants (Literals)
* Strings
* Special symbols/characters
* Operators

### Compiler and Linker

Machine (Binary) <=> Operating System (Object Codes) <=> C Program (Humans)
Compiler and linker are between OS and C Program

## Data

* Data - Raw facts
* Information - Processed meaningful data

### Data Types

1. Basic datatypes

* int
* float
* char
* void
* double
* short
* long
* string

2. Derived datatypes

* Arrays
* Functions
* Pointers
* Unions (`union`)
* Structures (`struct`)

3. Enumeration datatypes

* `enum`

### Memory storage

Memory addresses are stored in hexadecimal

* Binary digit is called a **bit**
* 8 Bits = 1 Byte

First digit of a binary number is called **MSB (Most signifiant bit)**

Last digit of a binary number is called **LSB (Least signifiant bit)**

## Software development life cycle

| Number | Phase | Engineer |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| 1 | Analysis | Product Owner, Project Manager, Business Analysist, CTO |
| 2 | Design | System architect, Ui/UX Designer |
| 3 | Development | Front-end developer, Back-end developer |
| 4 | Testing | Solutions Architect, QA Engineer, Tester, DevOps |
| 5 | Deployment | Data Administrator, DevOps |
| 6 | Maintanence | Users, Testers, Support managers|

**Designing is important for software development. Planning is required**

## Algorithm

**An algorithm is a step by step process to solve a problem**
An algorithm is essentially a plan

### Flowchart

Diagrammatic representation of an algorithm

| Column1   | Column2    |
|--------------- | --------------- |
| Oval   | Terminal (Start/Stop)  |
| Rectangle   | Process   |
| Diamond   | Decision   |
| Parallelogram   | Input/Output   |
| Circle | Connector |
| Arrow/Line ---> | Flow Line |
