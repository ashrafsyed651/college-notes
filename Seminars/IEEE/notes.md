Computer Society of India was formed by a group of people in 1965.

Information is an asset.

Service $\rightarrow$ product

## Hardware

* Growth in SOC and SBC.
* More growth in Thin clients and virtual desktops, usage of cloud computing and lower popularity in physical hardware.
* Quantum computers and bio computers.
* Current trend, GPU and TPU (Tensor processing Unit).

### Storage devices

* Holographic storage, molecular memory and DNA storage.
* Cloud based IaaS
* Open hardware
    1. Project Ara
    2. Open bridge rack
    3. Facebook open compute

## Software and applications

* PROMS, Mobile OS, RTOS
* Low code/no code, high level programming to HLL to OOL (Object Oriented Languages)
* Software engineering:
    * BPM
    * Agile
    * Testing
    * Standards
    * UI/UX engineering (Usability engineering) (*)
    * DevOps
* File system $\rightarrow$ database $\rightarrow$ distributed databases
* Utilities $\rightarrow$ Productivity applications $\rightarrow$ Browsers $\rightarrow$ Cloud based PaaS, SaaS, XaaS
* MRP (Make Your Plan) $\rightarrow$ ERP (Enterprice resource planning) $\rightarrow$ CRM (Customer resource management) $\rightarrow$ SCP (Supply Chain Product) $\rightarrow$ DT (Digital Transformation)
* Mobile applications: LBS (Location based Services)
* ICT based applications is used in all sectors
* Language computing: KM (Knowledge management) $\rightarrow$ NLP (Natural Language Processing) $\rightarrow$ AI (Artificial Intelligence) $\rightarrow$ ML (Machine Learning)
* MIS $\rightarrow$ DSS $\rightarrow$ Expert Systems $\rightarrow$ BI $\rightarrow$ CI $\rightarrow$ Business analytics $\rightarrow$ Big data $\rightarrow$ Data Science.
* NLP $\rightarrow$ NLU (Natural Language Understanding)
* Proprietary applications $\rightarrow$ FOSS and Open source systems
* Software managed (hardware managed is difficult to modify in future)
* ITES/BPO, Service outsourcing, KPO (Knowledge Process Outsourcing), LPO (Legal Process Outsourcing)

## Networking

* Interplanetary internet
* Web $\rightarrow$ Web 2.0 $\rightarrow$ Web 3.0
* Communications: POTS, wireless, NFC, 4G, 5G, 6G, Ethernet, Quantum communications

    * Internet.org (Facebook)
    * Drones
    * Starlink (SpaceX)
    * Project Kuiper (Amazon)
    * OneWeb (Airtel, UK Govt)
* IoT: IoMT (Medical), RFID, H2M, M2M (Machine to Machine), Connected cars
* Migration of IPv4 to IPv6

## Security

* Post Quantum Encryption, QKD
* BYOD (Bring Your Own Device, prime problem factor)
* Risk management, Compliance (Data Privacy Act, etc)
* Disaster recovery and Business Continuity, Critical Infrastructure Security (Power, Water supply, Healthcare sector)
* Digital Forensics (*)
* Cyber and Cloud Security, Cyber Warfare, Internet Governance (Leads to privacy issues)

* Digital preservation (*)

## IEEE

Innovation is making existing things better.

IEEE is the world leading professional association for advancement of Technology. It is a non-profit.

IEEE develops internet standards. Example 802.11 Wi-Fi standard.

IEEE Xplore: Online library. Free of cost to student members.

IEEE TV: Online participation for IEEE conferences. Free.
